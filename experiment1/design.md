In this challenge, I separated the app into 3 main sections: characters, movies and quotes.

For the movies section, I pulled data from the corresponding API
For the characters section, I opted to display a random subset of available characters.
I did the same for the quotes and using the quotes and characters APIs, attached the character who said the quote

I created a reusable card component and layout component using NextJS.
CSS Modules were used.
API data is grabbed on page loaded and cached by the browser. To retrieve new information, the user must refresh the page.
